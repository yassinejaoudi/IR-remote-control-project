# IR-remote-control-project

## Team Members:
* Yassine Jaoudi
* Venkataramani Kumar

## Features Built:
* Pressing the channel number causes the designated LED from the DE2 board to illuminates
* Pressing the Mute pushbutton alternatively illuminates/extinguishes the Mute LED (LEDR[12])
* While pressing the Volume Up or Down pushbutton, the designated LED illuminates otherwise it remains extinguished

## Lessons learned:
* Git version control
* Finite State Machine
* Advanced understanding of the DE2 115 FPGA board
* ModelSim Simulator
* VHDL
* RTL Representation
* Debugging strategies
* Teamwork and Time management

## Hardware Design Formal Report:
The [report](IR-remote-control-project/Final%20Project%20Report.pdf) file have a thorough of the design process, all the debugged faced issues, and the results.
